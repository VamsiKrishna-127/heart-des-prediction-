🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical attributes. By leveraging classification algorithms and proper evaluation metrics, we identify the most effective model for early diagnosis support.

📌 Objective
Predict the presence or absence of heart disease using structured medical data.

Compare multiple classification algorithms.

Analyze model performance to guide healthcare decision-making.
